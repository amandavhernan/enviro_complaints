<br/>
3/29/23 â†’ discovered bot is very broken
## Update | 3/19/23
I currently have a partially finished bot. After break, I want to experiment with the formatting of the bot's messages. I specifically want to make the messages more engaging and easier to read. I would also like to incorporate some kind of visual element into the bot's message. 
The main blocker I'm experiencing is that I'm not entirely confident that what I have will work properly and if it's the most efficient way to build my bot. My bot is currently set to run once a day. In addition to sending messages on Slack, my ideal bot would also update data on an accompanying site that displays analysis and graphics such as maps or charts. At the moment, I'm not sure how that would work, but I know I want to use GitHub Actions. 
Some of my stretch goals include:
* Improve bot's message format 
* Learn how to incorporate images or graphics into bot's message
* Use GitHub Actions to build an updatable site
